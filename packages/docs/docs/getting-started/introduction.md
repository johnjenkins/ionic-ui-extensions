Ionic UI is an open-source library of UI components based on Ionic Framework web components, featuring examples commonly required in enterprise applications.

It includes all of the commonly used components that an app requires, such as buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars, modals, but also some more advanced interactive elements such as datepickers.

All of the elements are built using the frameworks that power your Ionic application or no framework at all.

## Licensing

The library of components from Ionic UI is open source under the MIT License.
